# Sai Dheeraj Koneti 👨‍💻

> *AI Software Engineer passionate about Machine Learning, Computer Vision, LLMs, and efficient Model Deployment.*

### 🧐 About Me
I am a Computer Science engineer specializing in Artificial Intelligence.I have experience building industrial-grade AI solutions, including a user manual chatbot for **ESAB India** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).Previously, I worked as a Research Intern at **IIITDM Kancheepuram**, focusing on non-invasive cattle recognition using Retinal Vein biometrics.
   
### 🔬 Technical Expertise

#### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & LLMs
**Generative AI:** Expert in implementing RAG pipelines with Open Source LLMs (Llama 3.1) and vector stores.
**Computer Vision:** Deep understanding of Object Detection (YOLO, RetinaNet) and Image Compression using Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE).
**Data Science:** Feature engineering, data collection, and processing for industrial machine learning applications.

#### 💻 Engineering & Deployment
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Flask.
**Frontend:** ReactJS, Flutter (Mobile).
**Deployment:** Model serialization (pickle), API integration, and real-time data processing.

### 📂 Featured Projects
1.  **ESAB User Manual Chatbot:** Processed table/text data for a RAG chatbot using Llama 3.1 and BAAI embeddings.
2.  **Cattle Recognition System:** Real-time muzzle detection using YOLOv7 and ResNet50+FAISS embeddings for identification.Deployed a mobile app
3.  **AUV Image Compression:** Developed a system using CAEs to optimize storage for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles.
